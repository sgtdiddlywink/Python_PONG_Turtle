# Python_PONG_Turtle
Python code for playing PONG utilizing the Turtle Module.  This is part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Projects.

I take no credit for this code other than writing it from the lesson and changing it a bit and adding my notes.  

Ensure you have the proper modules installed and run off main.py.
